# AutoPeerReviewJ

This is the original Java code that is responsible for the creation of the AutoPeerReview product. This code was used for the initial research and determinations of Parts of Speech/Sentence Length for the different titles and famous pieces. All of the data used in this was given in textfiles (not included for copyright purposes) from my english teacher at the time, Brett Ramsay.

If you have any issues with running or trying to get it to work on your device, feel free to open an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
